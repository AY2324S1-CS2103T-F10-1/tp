### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings for hotel employees. With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the necessary information needed at a glance, and the application
being optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), we have combined elegance and efficiency when it comes to
the process of room booking for hotel receptionists.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added remarks (Pull request [#164](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/pull/164))
  * What it does: Allows the user to add remarks to the individual bookings.
  * Justification: Expands the booking system's capabilities, allowing for the inclusion of additional, important information which could be specific guest requests or internal notes.
  * Highlights: This involved familiarising myself with every aspect of the Command implementation, from the user input to the UI update.
