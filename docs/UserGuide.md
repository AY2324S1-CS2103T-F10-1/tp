# CheckMate User Guide
CheckMate is a **desktop app for streamlining the process of room bookings for hotel employees, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Input Formats

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
### Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [rm/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe rm/Extra Pillows` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `r/ROOM d/BOOKING_PERIOD`, `d/BOOKING_PERIOD r/ROOM` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

### Prefix Completion

Pressing `tab` while inputting a command will autocomplete relevant command prefix with examples. If no prefixes are found, your input will blink red.

Example:

* `add` followed by `space` and `tab` results in `add r/1`.
* `edit INDEX` followed by `space` and `tab` 
  * gives the unused prefix with the actual information for the booking at the index.

Prefix completions works with `add` and `edit` command and does not validate your input format.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
